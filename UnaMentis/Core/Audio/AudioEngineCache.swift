// UnaMentis - Audio Engine Cache
// Keeps AudioEngine warm between view transitions for instant resume
//
// When a user navigates away from a reading/playback view and returns,
// the AudioEngine normally needs reconfiguration (~200-500ms). This
// cache keeps a configured, running AudioEngine available for a timeout
// period, eliminating the delay on quick re-entry.
